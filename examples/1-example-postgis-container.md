# example of successful container creation and usage
A user needed a remote service running:
- postgresql
- postgis

so he could access a remote database, and have the ability to install
extensions, and let the cluster do the computation.

This is the list of steps that were needed to configure and run the container
in the ICRA's HPC cluster.

## step 1: download the official postgis container image and create a sandbox to configure it
```
$ sudo singularity build --sandbox pgcontainer docker://postgis/postgis
```
"pgcontainer" was the name chosen for this example, but it can be any name.
This command creates the folder "pgcontainer", which is the sandbox itself.

## step 2: enter the sandbox container using --writable mode
```
$ sudo singularity shell --writable pgcontainer/
```

## step 3: configure postgresql files
```
Singularity> su postgres -c "initdb"       #populate the $PGDATA folder (default is /var/lib/postgresql/data)
Singularity> cd $PGDATA                    #go to the $PGDATA folder
Singularity> vim postgresql.conf           #edit file: enable the listen port to "5432"
Singularity> vim pg_hba.conf               #edit file: allow remote access from all hosts ("0.0.0.0/0")
Singularity> su postgres -c "pg_ctl start" #start postgresql
```

## step 4: setup postgres password
log in into the psql console:
```
Singularity> su postgres -c "psql"
```
In the psql console, change the password and quit:
```
postgres=# \password postgres
Enter new password: <new-password>
postgres=# \q
```

## step 5: exit the sandbox container
```
Singularity> su postgres -c "pg_ctl stop"
Singularity> exit
```

## step 6: run the container
create an instance of the container, mapping the "internal" port (5432) to the "external" port (from the host) 54320:
```
$ singularity instance start --writable-tmpfs --net --network-args "portmap=54320:5432/tcp" pgcontainer/ pgcontainer
```
The pgcontainr instance will need to be able to write to disk, so weâ€™ve used
the --writable-tmpfs argument to allocate some space in memory.

The --net and --network-args options allow the incoming traffic follow this path:

request --> [cluster_address:54320] --> [container_address:5432]

Now we enter the container and start the postgresql service:
```
$ singularity shell instance://pgcontainer
Singularity> su postgres -c "pg_ctl start"
```

## step 7: final checks
check process:
```
Singularity> su postgres -c "pg_ctl status"
```
output:
```
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 30)
/usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/postgres
```
check port:
```
Singularity> netstat -na
```
output:
```

```

## step 8: connect remotely to the container using psql or pgAdmin in your local machine
If everything worked, now we should be able to connect to the container from the outside:

- Host name/address: the remote IP of your cluster
- Port: 54320 (or whatever you set in the step 6)
- Username: postgres
- Password: the one you set in step 4
